1)	Download recAnalyst.
	You can obtain the latest recAnalyst release from http://recanalyst.sourceforge.net/.

2)	Extract recAnalyst archive to a local directory on your system.
	The files are in .7z format and can be extracted using a tool 7-Zip.

2)	Upload all files contained in this archive (retaining the directory structure)
	to a web accessible directory on your server or hosting account.

3)	Open file recAnalyst.config.php and edit following configuration constants:
	RA__MAPS_DIR			point to directory where you wish to save generated maps
	RA__RESEARCHES_DIR		point to to directory where you wish to save generated research timelines
	RA__RESOURCES_DIR		point to directory where you store resources required for recAnalyst
	(Feel free to modify other configuration constants to suit your needs.)

4)	Create directories described in previous step if don't exist and change the
	permission to be writeable by all (777 or -rwxrwxrwx within your FTP client)
	on the directories defined in RA__MAPS_DIR, RA__RESEARCHES_DIR configuration
	constants.
	
5)	If you wish to display analyzed results I recommend you to download the resource pack
	located at project's homepage.
